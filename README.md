Choco3
======

Choco3 is an open-source Java library for Constraint Programming.

Choco3 is not the continuation of Choco2, but a completly rewritten version.

Choco3 comes with:
- various type of variables (integer, boolean, set, graph and real),
- various state-of-the-art constraints (alldifferent, count, nvalues, etc.),
- various search strategies, from basic ones (fist_fail, smallest, etc.) to most complex (impact-based and activity-based search),
- explanation-based engine, that enables conflict-based back jumping, dynamic backtracking and path repair,

But also, a FlatZinc parser, facilities to interact with the search loop, etc.
